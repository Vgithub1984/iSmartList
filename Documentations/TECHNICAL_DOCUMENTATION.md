# Technical Documentation

## Architecture

iSmartList follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with the following components:

### Models
- `MyList`: Represents a list with properties for name, creation date, items, and status
- `ListItem`: Represents an individual item within a list with completion status
- `DataStore`: Centralized data management and business logic
- `UserPreferences`: Manages user settings and preferences

### Views
- `ContentView`: Root view with tab-based navigation
- `ListsView`: Displays and manages active lists
- `DeletedView`: Shows and manages deleted lists with restore functionality
- `ProfileView`: User profile, settings, and app information
- `ListDetailView`: Detailed view for creating/editing lists and items
- `AccountView`: User account management
- `StorageView`: Storage usage and management
- `AboutView`: App information and version details
- `ContactView`: Support and feedback interface

### ViewModels
- `DataStore`: Manages app state, data persistence, and business logic
- Handles all CRUD operations for lists and items
- Manages user preferences and settings
- Provides computed properties for statistics and analytics

## Key Features Implementation

### State Management
- `@State` and `@Binding` for local view state
- `@EnvironmentObject` for global app state
- `@Published` properties for reactive updates
- `@AppStorage` for user preferences
- `@Environment` for system settings (color scheme, etc.)

### Data Persistence
- In-memory storage with `DataStore`
- Automatic state preservation
- Efficient data loading and caching
- Thread-safe data access

### UI Components
- Custom `SearchBar` with real-time filtering
- Animated list transitions
- Swipe actions for common tasks
- Custom alerts and action sheets
- Adaptive layout for different device sizes
- Dynamic type support
- Accessibility features
- Theming system with dark/light mode support

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of views
- Efficient list updates using `Identifiable`
- Minimized view updates
- Memory management
- Background processing for heavy operations
